    "Classify each raw carrier scan into the most accurate scan group from the list below.\n"
    "Scans come from multiple carriers with varied wording but similar meaning.\n\n"
    "Rules:\n"
    "1. Use ONLY a valid group from the list.\n"
    "2. Choose the most precise & specific match.\n"
    "3. If equally matched, return: unclear__['Group A', 'Group B']\n"
    "4. If no group fits, return: not_clear\n"
    "5. For new events not covered, return: new__<label>\n"
    "6. Do NOT explain — output JSON only.\n"
    "7. Base decisions on meaning, not wording.\n"
    "8. Use 'Internal activity scan' for backend/system events only (e.g., data merges).\n"
    "9. 'sort facility' or 'sorting center' → In Transit unless it's a clear arrival/departure.\n"
    "10. 'Arrival at delivery depot' = final depot before delivery.\n"
    "11. 'Departure Scan' = leaving any facility.\n"
    "12. Use 'In Transit' when movement is implied but vague.\n"
    "13. 'sub-depot', 'hub', or 'sorting center' = In Transit (not final destination).\n"
    "14. 'parent-child', 'inbound receipt', or similar = In Transit if no delivery context.\n"
    "15. Mentions of 'return', 'returns sort', 'returns depot' = In Transit **unless** clearly returned (e.g., 'Return of the package requested').\n"
    "16. 'held in trailer', 'held in cage' = Shipment on hold (awaiting unloading, not delivered).\n"
    "17. 'delivered left at [location] received by [name]' = Delivered to neighbour.\n"
    "18. 'delivered to security office' = Delivered.\n"
    "19. 'release authorized' = Driver release - Delivered to a safe place.\n"
    "20. POD scan codes (e.g. '^802$ POD') = Internal activity scan.\n"
    "21. Customer elects to keep damaged package = Internal activity scan.\n"
    "22. 'receiver has picked up' (past tense) = Delivered.\n"
    "23. 'delivered to pickup shop' or 'ready for collection' = Shipment ready for collection from pick-up point.\n"
    "24. 'delivery signature image available' = Internal activity scan.\n"
    "25. 'delivery instruction update' without confirmation = New instructions received – We updated the delivery information for your package.\n"
    "26. If scan contains 'picked up by consumer' or 'collected from depot' followed by a person/entity name, classify as Delivered.\n"
    "27. 'delivered left at/in' + physical location (locker, door, patio) = Driver release - Delivered to a safe place.\n"
    "28. EXCEPTION: 'mail room' or 'front desk' = Delivered.\n"
    "29. 'recipient on holiday' or 'no one present to sign' = Delivery attempted. Receiver not available for delivery.\n"
    "30. Locker-related issues (e.g. not collected, locker access problem) = Unable to deliver to pick-up point.\n"
    "31. Scan says 'request to contact carrier' = Not clear (ambiguous intent).\n"
    "32. If delivery was delayed due to operations, trailer, weather, or similar = Transit delay or sub-group accordingly.\n"
    "33. Damage during transit (e.g., 'package has been damaged') = Package damaged in transit.\n"
    "34. 'delivery to dpd pickup shop requested' = Delivery to pick-up point requested.\n\n"
