1. Example Compression (Minimal Few-Shot Demonstrations)
Few-shot prompting can greatly improve classification accuracy, but examples consume a lot of tokens. Example compression involves providing the fewest, most informative examples or condensing how they’re presented. Techniques include:
Use template-style examples: Instead of long-winded examples, use a compact template format to illustrate input-output. For instance, one OpenAI community solution suggests bundling a demonstration in one block:
makefile
Copy
Edit
Examples:  
User: [Input example]  
Response: [Desired JSON output]  
This shows the format in a minimal way​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. By labeling the example inline (as “User” and “Response” in a single system message), you avoid extra tokens for separate messages.
Provide only a minimal set of examples: Aim for just 1–3 examples that cover the task. Often a “couple of examples” are enough to guide GPT models​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. For instance, OpenAI’s guide demonstrates a few-shot prompt with only two examples before the actual query​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. Include one example per key scenario or class, rather than many redundant examples. This gives the model a pattern to follow with minimal overhead.
Generic placeholders: If feasible, use a generic example with placeholders instead of actual data. For example, one template could show how any input should map to output, rather than showing multiple different inputs. This relies on GPT-4’s ability to generalize from the template.
The key is to show the structure or task once or twice very clearly, then trust the model. GPT-4 in particular often generalizes well from just a few demonstrations. OpenAI recommends starting with zero-shot instructions, and only adding examples if needed​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
 – meaning you should not assume more examples are always better. In practice, a single well-chosen example can sometimes replace several verbose ones, drastically cutting prompt length while maintaining accuracy.
2. Rule Simplification and Token-Efficient Formatting
Streamline your instructions so that every token counts. Lengthy, verbose descriptions of the classification criteria can usually be shortened without losing meaning. Strategies include:
Use concise, direct language: Avoid rambling or imprecise wording. For example, instead of writing “The description for this product should be fairly short, a few sentences only, and not too much more,” you could state “Use a 3 to 5 sentence paragraph to describe this product.” This shorter version is clearer and wastes no tokens on ambiguity​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. Eliminate filler phrases (e.g. “fairly short, not too much more”) and replace them with exact requirements (e.g. “3 to 5 sentences”).
Bullet or number your rules: Structured lists can convey instructions efficiently. Each rule or criterion can be a bullet point or a numbered item, which tends to use fewer connecting words. For example, rather than a long paragraph of guidelines, list them like:
Classify based on content, not writing style.
If multiple categories apply, output all that apply.
Format the result as JSON with fields "label" and "confidence".
This format is easy for the model to parse and for you to ensure nothing is repeated. It also avoids the need for verbose transitions. (However, note that simply using bullets vs. short sentences may not impact the model’s understanding much – the main gain is from being succinct. One practitioner observed that “short, focused sentences separated by new lines” worked best, more so than full paragraphs or elaborate bullet lists​
EUGENEYAN.COM
.)
Leverage structure and formatting hints: Use delimiters or simple markup to separate sections instead of lengthy explanations. For instance, use headings like Instructions: or delimiters like """ or <tags> to clearly segment context from instructions​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
​
2BCLOUD.IO
. This avoids repeating phrases like “the following text is” for separation – the format does it for you. Anthropic even notes that using XML-style tags to delineate parts of the prompt can help their model Claude understand structure without extra verbiage​
2BCLOUD.IO
.
By simplifying rules and formatting them cleanly, you not only save tokens but also reduce complexity. The model is less likely to misunderstand a short, well-structured prompt. Clarity and brevity go hand in hand – every unnecessary word removed is one less chance for confusion. Ensure each instruction is necessary, distinct, and stated as plainly as possible.
3. Using Codes or Abbreviations for Frequent Terms
For structured classification, you might have recurring terms (category names, labels, etc.) that are long. Repeating these verbosely eats tokens. A solution is to define short codes or abbreviations for them in the prompt. For example, you could state: “Categories: D01 = Delivered, D02 = In Transit, D03 = Out for Delivery.” Then, in rules and examples, use D01 instead of the full word "Delivered". This can significantly cut down prompt length if those terms appear often. However, there are important caveats to doing this effectively:
Define the mapping clearly: Always introduce the abbreviation or code so the model knows what it means. A tiny upfront cost (as in the mapping above) ensures the model won’t be confused. After that, you can use the code throughout.
Use simple, model-friendly codes: Stick to alphanumeric codes or short words that the model is likely to handle. Avoid exotic symbols or overly cryptic codes. Research has shown that certain “compressed” encodings can backfire – for instance, replacing text with emoji or overly dense notation ended up using more tokens, due to how the tokenizer works​
GIST.GITHUB.COM
. GPT tokenizers might split an unfamiliar code into multiple pieces. So D01 (three characters) might be one token or two, but a weird emoji could be several tokens. As a rule of thumb, test your abbreviations: ensure the code is actually shorter token-wise than the original phrase. Often, common abbreviations or a single letter + number code are efficient.
Don’t invent an entire new language: Keep the codes limited. If you replace everything with made-up tokens, the prompt may lose transparency and the model might “disrespect it – or your task”​
OLICKEL.COM
​
OLICKEL.COM
. In other words, using a modest lookup table of a few codes is fine, but don’t force the model to learn a complex encoding scheme on the fly. “Don’t invent custom formats. Use and modify what’s already in the model’s lexicon,” as one expert put it​
OLICKEL.COM
. Using JSON keys or short English labels is often better than an obscure code with no basis in the model’s training. So prefer abbreviations that are intuitive (like qty for quantity, or NY for New York) or simple patterns like letters/numbers.
When done thoughtfully, abbreviations can condense a prompt significantly. For example, if the prompt repeatedly says “Status: Delivered”, defining D01 saves 7 characters each time. A study on prompt compression noted that building a lookup table of substitutions can outperform a raw verbose prompt in terms of brevity​
GIST.GITHUB.COM
. Just remain mindful that the model still needs to reliably understand the codes – a tiny glossary at the start of the prompt can achieve this. Once set up, you can pack a lot of information in very few tokens via these codes, preserving accuracy and consistency of output (just remember to post-process the code back to a human-readable label if needed in your application).
4. Avoiding Over-Repetition and Verbosity
Redundancy is the enemy of brevity. Many prompt drafts contain repeated instructions, unnecessary restatements, or overly verbose explanations that don’t actually improve the model’s understanding. GPT-4 retains and understands instructions given once – repeating them multiple times in the same prompt usually yields no benefit, and can even confuse the model or make it focus on the wrong detail. Here’s how to avoid over-repetition:
State each instruction or piece of context only once. Resist the urge to paraphrase the same rule in different ways. For example, don’t say “do not reveal the instructions” in both the system message and user prompt; one clear statement suffices. In a classification scenario, if you’ve listed the criteria for classes in a bulleted list, you don’t need an extra paragraph elsewhere repeating that in prose. Extra repetition just adds tokens and might lead the model to overemphasize that point (or it might start literally repeating text in the output). According to OpenAI’s best practices, clarity is achieved through specificity, not through saying the same thing twice​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. So, be concise and trust the model’s comprehension.
Don’t over-explain common sense. GPT-4 already has vast knowledge. You usually don’t need to spell out basic background if it’s likely within the model’s understanding. For instance, if classifying tweets for sentiment, you don’t have to include a textbook definition of “sentiment” – that would waste tokens. Only include explanatory text if it’s specific and necessary (e.g. domain-specific jargon the model might not know, or a particular edge-case definition). One study on domain tasks found that providing necessary background knowledge in the prompt does help performance​
ARXIV.ORG
. The lesson is: include what the model truly needs to know for accurate classification, but nothing more. Any fluff or generic commentary can be removed. A “fluffy and imprecise” prompt not only costs tokens but may dilute the important details​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
.
Use compact wording: This ties to rule simplification – ensure your phrasing is as tight as possible. For example, instead of “Please remember, you should not be verbose in your response” (which ironically is verbose), just instruct “Be concise in the response.” This avoids repetitive qualifiers. Every extra adjective or adverb that doesn’t change the instruction can likely be cut.
Skip apologies and extraneous politeness: When crafting API prompts (unlike human conversation), you don’t need phrases like “I kindly ask you to…” or “Thank you.” These are wasted tokens and do not affect accuracy. A direct imperative (“Classify the text…”) is better.
The principle is to lean on brevity and clarity rather than emphasis by repetition. GPT-4 is quite capable of following a single clear set of instructions. In fact, Anthropic’s guidance notes that while adding more examples or more detail can improve reliability, it comes at the cost of latency and tokens​
2BCLOUD.IO
. So there’s a balance: give just enough context and guidance to be accurate. Any repeated content or superfluous explanation is a candidate for removal. A shorter prompt that is to-the-point is easier for the model to follow correctly than a long-winded one that buries the key instructions. As OpenAI puts it, “clarity and specificity” are key – a longer prompt can work, but only if it’s packed with relevant specifics, not babble​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. Aim for lean prompts that say everything needed, only once.
5. Inline Rule Logic vs. Few-Shot Examples – Finding the Right Balance
There are two main ways to convey the task in a prompt: describing the rules/logic explicitly, or showing examples that implicitly demonstrate the logic. Each has pros and cons for prompt length and accuracy:
Inline rule logic: This means writing out the classification criteria or decision process. For example, you might write: “If the message contains any profanity, label it as ‘Toxic’. If it has a question mark and is polite, label it ‘Inquiry’. Otherwise label it ‘Other’.” This approach can be very concise if the rules are straightforward. It uses far fewer tokens than giving multiple examples for each case. Moreover, GPT-4 is quite adept at following complex instructions – it was trained on following human-written directives, so a clear logical description can be enough. Using inline logic avoids ambiguity because you’re directly telling the model the conditions. This often works well for GPT-4, which improved “steerability” and can handle nuanced instructions better than GPT-3. For instance, a user of GPT-4 might supply a list of conditions and get perfect JSON outputs matching those conditions without needing any example, thanks to GPT-4’s instruction-following strength (something much less likely with older models). OpenAI’s advice to “start with zero-shot” underscores that you should try pure instructions first​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
 – many times, especially with GPT-4, that’s sufficient.
Few-shot examples: This is the classic “don’t tell me, show me” approach. Instead of (or in addition to) describing rules, you give example inputs with their correct outputs. The model then infers the rules. Few-shot prompting is very powerful for guiding GPTs – Anthropic notes that examples are “probably the single most effective tool” for steering models​
2BCLOUD.IO
. They also help in tricky edge cases where an explicit rule may be hard to articulate succinctly. The downside is token cost: each example might be dozens of tokens, and you might need several to cover all scenarios. There’s also a limit to how many examples you can include before hitting diminishing returns. Empirically, adding a couple of well-chosen examples can boost accuracy (especially if zero-shot was confusing), but adding 10 examples might not be proportionally better than 3 examples. It “trades off some efficiency for better performance”, as one prompt engineering reference notes​
PROMPTENGINEERING.ORG
. So it’s about finding the minimal number of examples that achieves near-maximum accuracy.
Trade-off: Using inline logic keeps the prompt short, but only works if the model correctly interprets the instructions. Using examples can make the task crystal clear through demonstration, but at the cost of prompt length. Sometimes a hybrid works best: for instance, give a brief rule description and one example to illustrate it. This can reinforce the instruction without adding much bulk. Consider the complexity of your classification rules:
If the rules are easily described (and especially if they’re deterministic conditions), try just writing them out. GPT-4 often excels at these structured tasks with only instructions, thanks to function calling and structured output improvements. For example, with the new OpenAI structured output (JSON mode), one might not need any examples – just the schema and a directive, and GPT-4 will comply​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
.
If the rules are nuanced or pattern-based (like sentiment or topic classification where you rely on model’s intuition), examples might convey the idea better. In such cases, compress the examples as discussed earlier (template format, minimal set).
OpenAI’s best practice is iterative: start with instructions, add examples if needed​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. Measure the accuracy: if the model is misunderstanding something, see if that can be fixed by a small clarification in the rules (cheaper than adding a big example). If not, an example addressing that confusion might be worthwhile. Also, remember GPT-4’s robust context can handle a reasonable number of examples if truly needed, but each one costs tokens and latency. So the sweet spot is to use as few examples as possible, and only to cover what instructions alone can’t. This way, you maintain a slim prompt while ensuring accuracy doesn’t drop.
6. Prompt Length vs. Performance – What Do Studies and Experience Say?
It’s natural to worry that trimming the prompt might remove information and hurt accuracy. Indeed, there is a tension: prompts must be detailed enough to be specific, yet concise enough to be efficient. What does research say about prompt length and classification performance?
Longer (relevant) prompts can help, to a point: A 2024 study examined LLM performance on domain-specific tasks under different prompt lengths. It found that “long prompts, providing more background knowledge about the domain, are generally beneficial” for accuracy​
ARXIV.ORG
. In fact, across tasks like sentiment analysis and intent classification, shorter prompts that omitted important context were detrimental​
ARXIV.ORG
. This means you shouldn’t cut critical information purely to save tokens – losing key context will hurt accuracy more than it helps cost. The takeaway is to include all essential details or definitions the model needs for the task. If domain knowledge or disambiguation is required for correct classification, it’s better to supply that concisely rather than leave it out. In other words, brevity should not come at the expense of clarity or necessary content.
However, extraneous length is harmful or wasteful: The same study and others implicitly note that once you’ve included the needed info, extra padding doesn’t improve performance and just adds noise. Many practitioners report that beyond a certain point, adding more to the prompt yields diminishing or even negative returns. For example, a very long prompt stuffed with mostly irrelevant text can confuse the model’s focus. It’s also known that models pay more attention to the beginning and end of the prompt than the middle for very long inputs​
OLICKEL.COM
. This means if your prompt is too lengthy, some instructions might get “lost in the middle.” Thus, a leaner prompt can actually be more effective by keeping all instructions salient.
GPT-4 vs earlier models: Notably, GPT-4 is better at zero-shot and following instructions than GPT-3.5. OpenAI noted that newer models “tend to be easier to prompt engineer”​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
, meaning you can often use fewer examples or shorter prompts and still get good results. For classification, GPT-4 can often infer what you want from a well-phrased instruction or two, where a smaller model might have needed several examples. This improved capability lets us trim prompts aggressively. At the same time, GPT-4 has a huge context window (up to 128K tokens in the newest version​
PROMPTINGGUIDE.AI
), so it can handle long prompts if necessary – but you’ll be paying in tokens, so it’s wise to shorten the prompt unless those extra tokens clearly boost accuracy. Essentially, GPT-4 gives you the freedom to include context when needed, but its intelligence often makes it unnecessary to overload the prompt with repetitive examples or explanations.
Empirical tip: find the minimal effective prompt. Anecdotal evidence from prompt engineers suggests an approach of start small and add incrementally. You might find that a 50-token prompt gets say 90% accuracy, and doubling it to 100 tokens (with an extra example or detail) gets you to 95% – that might be worthwhile. But taking it to 300 tokens may only gain another 1% and cost much more. Benchmarking different prompt lengths on your specific task is valuable​
MEDIUM.COM
. As one Medium case study noted, treat prompt design like hyperparameter tuning – start simple, evaluate, then increase complexity if needed​
MEDIUM.COM
.
Few-shot vs. fine-tuning: If you find you need an extremely large prompt (many examples or lots of text) to reach the desired accuracy, that’s a signal. At that point, fine-tuning a model or using retrieval (RAG) might be more efficient than cramming the prompt. OpenAI’s docs mention after few-shot and other tricks, the next step could be fine-tuning​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. A Reddit user observed that for high-volume simple classification, replacing a giant GPT-4 prompt with a smaller fine-tuned model (like BERT) saved cost and was easier to scale​
REDDIT.COM
​
REDDIT.COM
. This is beyond prompt engineering, but it’s worth noting: if your prompt is becoming essentially a static dataset of examples, other approaches might be better.
In summary, prompt length should be as short as possible but no shorter. Include what’s necessary to avoid misclassification, but strip out everything else. Real-world tests and research concur that the leanest prompt that fully specifies the task yields the best balance of accuracy and efficiency. When in doubt, err on the side of clarity (even if it adds a few tokens), but if something doesn’t demonstrably improve results, cut it out.
Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Designing a compact prompt for GPT-4 classification is an exercise in distillation – you want to distill the task’s requirements into the fewest tokens that still convey everything important. By using the techniques above, you can shrink prompt size without losing accuracy. To recap, here are the actionable takeaways for prompt compression in classification tasks:
Show minimal examples only if needed: Prefer zero-shot with clear instructions; add 1-2 examples if the model needs guidance​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. Use a compact format (template or combined example block) for any demonstrations​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. No more examples than necessary – each extra example costs tokens.
Simplify and bullet your instructions: Replace long-winded descriptions with concise statements or lists. Be specific and omit fluff​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. Structured lists of rules (or separate lines) improve clarity and save tokens compared to a verbose paragraph.
Use abbreviations judiciously: Identify any frequently repeated terms (labels, fields, etc.) and introduce short codes or acronyms for them. Ensure the model knows what each code means​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
, and avoid overly cryptic symbols that might tokenize poorly​
GIST.GITHUB.COM
. When used correctly, these placeholders can significantly compress the prompt length.
Avoid repeating yourself: State instructions once – don’t rephrase the same point multiple times. Remove any redundant or irrelevant information. Every sentence in the prompt should serve a distinct purpose. Reducing such verbosity both cuts tokens and focuses the model​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
.
Leverage GPT-4’s strength in following instructions: You can often get away with just instructions (inline logic) for straightforward classification, thanks to GPT-4’s improved comprehension. Use examples mainly for edge cases or when instructions alone fail. This keeps the prompt lean while maintaining accuracy.
Test prompt variations for optimal length: If unsure, experiment with shorter vs longer prompts and measure the accuracy. You may find that a 50-token prompt works as well as a 200-token prompt. Keep the version that is shorter unless the longer one demonstrably improves performance​
ARXIV.ORG
. In general, more context helps until it starts including stuff the model doesn’t actually need – find that sweet spot.
By applying these techniques, you can craft prompts that are token-efficient yet effective for classification. Practitioners have successfully used these methods on GPT-4 and even the new GPT-4 “JSON mode” to yield reliable structured outputs with minimal prompt size​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
​
STACKOVERFLOW.COM
. The result: faster, cheaper classification with high accuracy. Remember, the best prompt is not the longest or the shortest per se – it’s the sharpest. Aim for a prompt that is just long enough to clearly and unambiguously direct the model, and not a word (or token) more. With GPT-4’s capabilities and the strategies outlined here, you can achieve excellent classification results without the prompt ever becoming bloated.

Prompt Engineering Best Practices for GPT-4 Classification Tasks
Optimized System Prompt for Classification Accuracy
To kick off, here is a rewritten system prompt tailored for classifying short, domain-specific texts (like carrier scan events) into predefined categories. This prompt is designed with GPT-4 in mind, emphasizing clarity, constraints, and context to improve accuracy:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
You are an AI assistant specialized in shipping logistics. Your task is to classify short **"carrier scan events"** into one of the following categories:

- **Out for Delivery** – Package is on its final delivery route to the recipient.  
- **Delivered** – Package has been delivered to the recipient or final destination.  
- **In Transit** – Package is en route between locations or undergoing routine processing (not yet out for final delivery).  
- **Exception** – An unexpected issue or delay occurred (e.g. customs hold, weather delay, delivery attempt failed).  
- **Pickup** – Package is ready for pickup or has been picked up from a facility by the carrier.

When given a scan event description, **analyze it carefully** and output **only the single category name** (exactly as listed above) that best fits the event. If the scan text is vague or ambiguous, choose the category that is **most likely** correct based on typical logistics operations. **Do not produce any extra text** or categories outside of the list.
This system prompt establishes the role (a logistics expert assistant), enumerates the allowed categories with brief definitions, and provides explicit instructions about output format and handling ambiguity. By framing the task with domain context and constraints, GPT-4 is more likely to classify consistently and accurately.
Clear and Structured Prompt Formatting
When engineering prompts for classification, format and phrasing are crucial for guiding GPT-4. Here are recommendations for structuring your prompts:
Put Instructions First: Always lead with the task instructions and context before providing the input text. GPT models respond better when the prompt clearly states what to do before showing the content to act on​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. In a chat setting, a well-crafted system message (like the example above) can persist these instructions for all inputs.
Enumerate Categories Explicitly: List out the target categories the model must choose from. Present them in a clear format (bullet list or numbered list) and consider adding brief descriptions or examples for each category. This helps GPT-4 understand subtle differences, especially for domain-specific labels. For example, explicitly providing Classes or categories in the prompt has been shown to be effective in zero-shot classification​
MEDIUM.COM
. In the prompt above, each category is defined to anchor the model’s understanding (e.g. what counts as an “Exception” event).
Separate Context from Instructions: Use formatting or delimiters to distinguish any context or examples from the directive. For instance, you might label sections like “### Categories ###” and “### Instructions ###” or use a clear separator (such as a line break or triple quotes) between the list of categories and the actual query​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
​
MEDIUM.COM
. This reduces confusion and ensures the model knows which part is the text to classify versus the guidance.
Be Specific About Output Format: State exactly how the answer should be given. If you want only the category name as output, say so explicitly. In the example prompt, the model is told to output “only the single category name” and nothing else. This kind of instruction helps prevent the model from adding explanations or unsupported categories. In one real-case prompt, the designer wrote: “Result should include only the category in this format: {"most suitable category"}. You must select only one of the available categories... You cannot include a category that is not part of [the list].”​
REDDIT.COM
. Such phrasing imposes a strict constraint that mitigates the risk of the model producing irrelevant or made-up labels.
Use a Deterministic Setting: Though not part of the prompt text itself, it’s worth noting that when calling GPT-4 via API for classification, you should set the temperature to 0. This ensures the model’s output is deterministic and focused, always picking the highest-probability completion (minimizing random misclassifications)​
COMMUNITY.OPENAI.COM
. A carefully engineered prompt combined with temperature=0 will yield consistent categorizations on each run.
By structuring the prompt with clear sections (role, categories, instructions) and explicit requirements, you make it easier for GPT-4 to parse what you want and to comply. Clarity and specificity are key – as one set of guidelines puts it, “be specific, descriptive and as detailed as possible about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style, etc.”​
HELP.OPENAI.COM
. A well-structured prompt acts almost like a contract that the model will strive to fulfill.
Role Prompting and Domain Context
Including a role or persona in the prompt can sometimes focus the model’s responses. For instance, starting with “You are an AI assistant specialized in shipping logistics” primes GPT-4 with relevant domain knowledge and vocabulary. This kind of role prompting is a common technique where the model is asked to adopt a certain perspective or expertise​
MEDIUM.COM
. In practice, role instructions can help set the tone or context (e.g., an expert classifier will likely be more concise and factual). However, it’s important to note that role prompting is not a magic bullet for accuracy. Recent research suggests that adding personas in system prompts “does not improve model performance across a range of questions” on factual or accuracy-driven tasks compared to not using a persona​
MEDIUM.COM
. In other words, telling the model it’s an expert may help with tone or confidence, but it won’t automatically fix classification errors. The content of the instructions and examples tends to matter more than a role label. That said, domain context is still valuable. If your texts are highly domain-specific (such as internal logistics scan codes or medical jargon), briefly providing context or definitions can improve the model’s understanding. For example, clarifying that “these phrases come from package tracking updates” helps the model interpret a term like "Out for delivery" in the right context. In the prompt example, we set the stage by specifying the domain (shipping logistics) and defining each category in that context. This ensures GPT-4 isn’t drawing on a wrong interpretation of a phrase. In short, use the system (or prompt) to embed any domain knowledge the model might need, but don’t rely solely on a “persona” for better performance. Focus on concrete instructions and clarity in domain terminology.
Zero-Shot vs. Few-Shot Prompting
Zero-shot prompting refers to asking the model to perform the classification task with no examples – only the instructions and input. GPT-4 is quite powerful zero-shot; often just listing the classes and saying “Classify the text into one of the above classes” can work​
MEDIUM.COM
. If your domain is simple or well-covered in training data, zero-shot may yield high accuracy. Always start with the simplest prompt possible and see how the model does. If zero-shot performance is not satisfactory (e.g., the model gets confused by ambiguous wording or minor nuances), consider moving to few-shot prompting. Few-shot prompting means you include a few demonstration examples of inputs and the correct category outputs in the prompt. This technique has been “shown to improve the LLM’s performance on the task” when zero-shot isn’t enough​
MEDIUM.COM
. Essentially, you are helping GPT-4 learn from examples on the fly via the prompt, without any fine-tuning. How to incorporate few-shot examples? There are two common approaches:
Inline examples in one prompt: You can write a single prompt message that first lists a couple of examples with their classifications, then ends with the new input. For instance, in a user message you might write:
vbnet
Copy
Edit
Classify the text into one of the classes.  
Classes: [Delivered, Out for Delivery, In Transit, Exception, Pickup]  

Text: "Package has left the carrier facility."  
Class: In Transit  

Text: "Package delivered to front door."  
Class: Delivered  

Text: "Out for delivery."  
Class: Out for Delivery  

Text: "Shipment on hold due to weather."  
Class: Exception  

Text: "Package available for pickup at locker."  
Class: Pickup  

Text: "Package arrived at sorting center."  
Class:
Here, several examples are provided (with Text: and Class: labels) demonstrating the correct category for each. The prompt stops at a new Text that needs classification, and GPT-4 should continue by outputting the Class for that last text. This format mirrors the one used in an OpenAI example, where they listed a few movie review texts and their sentiments, and then provided a new text for the model to classify​
MEDIUM.COM
​
MEDIUM.COM
. It’s a straightforward way to do few-shot in a single message.
Few-shot via role messages (Chat format): If using the Chat Completion API or ChatGPT interface, you can embed examples as turns in the conversation before the actual query. For example, consider structuring the conversation history like this: System: (instructions and category list as above)
User: "Package has left the carrier facility."
Assistant: "In Transit"
User: "Package delivered to front door."
Assistant: "Delivered"
User: "Shipment on hold due to weather."
Assistant: "Exception"
User: "Out for delivery."
Assistant: "Out for Delivery"
User: "Package arrived at sorting center." In this approach, each User message is an example input and the following Assistant message is the correct category. By providing a few such QA pairs, you demonstrate the pattern. The last user message is the new item to classify, and GPT-4 will output an assistant message following the learned pattern​
REDDIT.COM
​
REDDIT.COM
. This method effectively uses in-context learning; GPT-4 sees how prior queries were answered and mimics that behavior for the new query (this is exactly what one forum answer referred to as “few-shot learning” in context​
REDDIT.COM
). Just be mindful of the total token length if you include many examples in this format.
Whether inline or as dialogue, make sure your few-shot examples are representative of the variety of inputs and are correct. The model will generalize from them. Demonstrating edge cases (like an ambiguous phrase mapped to a sensible category) can teach the model how to handle similar ambiguity in the actual query. Also, limit the number of examples to the minimum needed – you often see diminishing returns after a handful of examples, and too many can consume context or even confuse the model if not done carefully. A good practice is to start with 2–5 examples; research has shown that few-shot prompting with a small number of well-chosen examples can significantly boost accuracy over zero-shot in many tasks​
MEDIUM.COM
.
Designing Effective Few-Shot Examples
When creating few-shot examples for GPT-4 classification, consider the following tips to maximize clarity and alignment:
Mirror the Task Format: Ensure each example is formatted exactly like the actual task. If the input will be a raw scan event text and output just the category word, each example should reflect that. For instance, don’t include extraneous commentary in examples – keep them as Input -> Category. Consistency helps the model pick up the pattern.
Cover Different Scenarios: Pick examples that cover distinct categories and typical phrasings. For carrier scans, you might include one delivered example, one out-for-delivery, one in-transit, etc. Also include a tricky example if possible (e.g., a vaguely worded event) and show the correct resolution. This diversity helps the model learn decision boundaries. Few-shot works best when the examples “frame” the task’s scope. However, avoid extremely complex or compound examples that might introduce confusion.
Keep Examples Concise: Each example should be short and focused. Since scan events are short by nature, your demonstrations will be short too. This is good – the model doesn’t need a paragraph to see what to do. You might use a prefix like “Text:” and “Category:” (or “Class:”) to explicitly label the parts in your prompt (as shown in the inline example above and commonly used in prompt engineering guides​

). Explicit labeling within examples can reduce ambiguity about what is input vs. output.
Use Accurate Domain Language: Write your example scan events in realistic language that the model might see from real data. If the domain uses certain jargon or abbreviations, you can include them in examples (and explain them in the category if needed). For example, if a scan sometimes says "OFD" and that means "Out for Delivery", you might include an example: Text: "OFD – Package out for delivery." → Class: Out for Delivery. This teaches GPT-4 the abbreviation in context.
Order Examples Logically: There’s some evidence that ordering examples from simple to more complex can sometimes help, though GPT-4 is robust enough that it’s not extremely sensitive. Still, you might start with a very clear-cut example, then move to ones requiring more interpretation. The final query should ideally be of similar complexity to what was shown. (You wouldn’t, for instance, only show very easy examples and then expect the model to handle a highly ambiguous case – better to include one ambiguous example in the prompt as a guide.)
Test with and without examples: After designing a few-shot prompt, it’s wise to test GPT-4’s output on some known inputs. Ensure that the presence of examples is actually improving results over the zero-shot version. If an example is leading the model astray (perhaps due to some wording quirk), adjust or replace it. Few-shot prompting is somewhat empirical – small changes can affect outcomes, so it’s worth iterating to find the combination that yields the highest accuracy.
Remember, few-shot examples are essentially in-line training data. They should be high-quality and illustrative. When done well, they can dramatically improve classification accuracy by showing GPT-4 exactly how you expect it to perform the task​

. And as a practical note, if you plan on classifying many pieces of text in an automated fashion, you might not want to include a long list of examples on every single call (due to token usage). In such cases, you could fine-tune a smaller model or use a persistent system message with a few examples and then feed new queries as separate user messages (so you don’t resend examples each time). But for moderate usage or one-off analyses, a few-shot prompt with GPT-4 in one go can be very effective.
Handling Ambiguity and Misclassification
Classification of short texts can be challenging when the wording is vague or ambiguous. Carrier scan events often use terse language that might lack context (e.g., "Arrived at hub" – arrived from where? is it just in transit?). Here are strategies to mitigate misclassifications in such cases:
Provide Category Definitions or Keywords: As demonstrated in the prompt, giving a one-line definition for each category sets a clear guideline. If certain ambiguous phrases should map to a particular category, consider mentioning them in the definition. For example, if “Arrived at hub” or “In transit to next facility” are meant to be In Transit, you could hint that In Transit includes any arrival, departure, or transfer scans while the package is en route. By seeding the prompt with these keywords, you reduce the model’s uncertainty. Essentially, you’re preemptively disambiguating possible tricky phrases via the prompt.
Encourage Best-Fit Reasoning: Instruct the model on how to decide if a text is unclear. In the prompt, we say “if the scan text is vague, choose the category most likely correct based on typical operations.” This nudges GPT-4 to rely on its world knowledge (e.g., in typical shipping, an “arrived at facility” scan usually means the journey is ongoing, i.e. In Transit). The model will then lean on likelihood and context rather than guessing randomly. Without this instruction, GPT-4 might sometimes oscillate or give an arbitrary choice for ambiguous cases. By explicitly telling it how to resolve ambiguity, you guide it toward consistent decisions (essentially an implicit tie-break rule).
Avoid Bias from Prior Classifications: You mentioned reclassification where prior classification is not shown. This implies each item is classified independently (which is good practice). Ensure that your prompt does not refer to any previous answer or classification. Every query to GPT-4 should stand alone with just the instructions and the new text. In a system + user prompt setup, the system message holds the guidelines, and the user message holds the new event text. Since the prior label isn’t provided (and shouldn’t be), the model won’t be biased by it. In fact, if you are running multiple classifications in one continuous chat session, consider resetting the conversation or using a fresh session for each classification, unless you deliberately want the model to remember earlier ones. Residual memory of prior answers could introduce bias (for example, if the last 5 were “In Transit”, the model might develop a tendency – though GPT-4 with temperature 0 will usually stick strictly to input cues). The safest route is one prompt per item or a stateless approach with only the persistent system prompt. The instructions themselves (and any examples) provide all the needed context.
Introduce an “Unknown/Other” Category (if applicable): One way to handle truly ambiguous or novel inputs is to allow an “Other” or “Unknown” category. If the predefined categories don’t cover 100% of cases, giving the model an out-of-category option can prevent forced misclassifications. In the shipping example, we included Exception as a catch-all for unusual events. Depending on your use case, you might explicitly add an “Unknown” category defined as “Use this if the scan text does not clearly fit any other category.” This way, the model isn’t pressured to jam a square peg into a round hole. It will use Unknown only when appropriate. Be cautious, though: if you include an Unknown option, the model might overuse it unless you clarify it’s a last resort. Only include this if you truly expect some inputs that don’t belong to any category.
Double-Check Edge Cases: If certain scan phrases have historically been mislabeled, you can add a note in the instructions about them. For example, “Note: ‘Label created’ means the package has not been picked up yet, so classify as In Transit (not Out for Delivery).” Little clarification points like this can rectify specific confusion points. Essentially, you are encoding a tiny rule set into the prompt. GPT-4 is quite capable of following such rules when clearly stated, and it will incorporate them into its reasoning.
Structured Output Enforcement: As an advanced technique, consider using formatting or function calling to enforce correct outputs. OpenAI’s function calling feature allows you to define a JSON schema for the output. For instance, you can tell GPT-4 to output a JSON object with a field “category” that must be one of a fixed set of values. This leverages the model’s ability to follow a specification: “we can describe a JSON format and force the model to output an object with all required fields... enabling structured data back from the model reliably, which is necessary for text classification”​
MEDIUM.COM
. In practice, you might not need full function calling for a simple single-label output, but even providing a mini-format (like Category: <label>) can help. The key is consistency and leaving no room for the model to ramble off format. As noted, we explicitly forbid extra text in the prompt (“Do not produce any extra text or categories outside of the list.”) to keep the output clean. If you still occasionally get verbosity or uncertainty (e.g., “I think it might be Delivered”), tighten the instruction further: e.g., “Answer with only the category name and nothing else.” GPT-4 will respect that in most cases.
In summary, handle ambiguity by pre-defining how to resolve it. Provide as much disambiguating information in the prompt as possible (short of giving away the answer) – definitions, domain assumptions, and explicit instructions for uncertain cases. By doing so, you reduce the model’s room to make mistaken interpretations. Misclassifications often happen when the prompt under-specifies the task or the category boundaries. A well-engineered prompt fences in the model’s decision process, so even a vaguely worded input will be mapped to the intended category following the rules you’ve given.
Notable Patterns for GPT-4 Performance
Through practice and community insights, several patterns have emerged on how GPT-4 responds to prompt formats for classification:
Bullet Lists and Newlines Improve Clarity: Breaking out lists of options or criteria onto separate lines (rather than packing them in a run-on sentence) tends to make it clearer. Both for you and the model, a bullet-point list of categories (as we used above) is easy to scan. GPT-4 has likely seen many enumerated formats in training, so it handles them well. It’s less likely to overlook one of the listed items or confuse one category name for another when they are neatly separated. This format also makes it obvious that these are discrete choices, not part of the input text. Essentially, using a list format for categories helps delineate the choices as distinct tokens, which can reduce mis-selection.
Simplified and Distinct Category Names: If you have control over category naming, choose labels that are intuitive and distinct. Avoid heavy overlap in meaning. GPT-4 will sometimes struggle if two categories are very close semantically (e.g., “In Transit” vs “In Transit (Processing)” might confuse it unless you define the difference). In prompt engineering for classification, a known trick is to use clear labels or even short codes for categories if the original names are long or similar. For instance, one might label them [A] Delivered, [B] Out for Delivery, [C] In Transit, [D] Exception, [E] Pickup and ask for the appropriate letter. However, since the goal is readability and since GPT-4 can handle full words, using the full names with definitions is usually fine. Just make sure the model isn’t at risk of outputting something outside that set. If your categories were something like “Delivered” vs “Delivered to Agent” (two separate categories), you’d want to explicitly differentiate them in descriptions so GPT-4 doesn’t mix them up. In short, simpler, well-differentiated category names yield better accuracy.
Implicit vs. Explicit Constraints: GPT-4 generally follows explicit instructions closely (especially at temperature 0), but it also picks up on subtle cues. An implicit constraint means the prompt’s phrasing guides the model without overtly stating a rule. For example, phrasing the question as “Which category does this event belong to?” implicitly suggests the answer should be one of the given categories (and not a full sentence). However, relying only on implicit guidance can be risky if the model isn’t 100% sure – it might still produce a sentence like “It seems like it was delivered.” when you expected just Delivered. To be safe, favor explicit constraints: literally tell the model the format (one of the listed categories, no extra words). In our example prompt, we didn’t just imply the output should be a category; we directly said “output only the single category name (exactly as listed).” The more unambiguous your instructions, the less room for the model to deviate. Community experience has shown that models sometimes need that extra nudge to not be overly verbose or creative when you want a classification​

. Therefore, while GPT-4’s ability to infer intent is strong (it might implicitly know it should pick a category), reinforcing the rules explicitly is a best practice for reliability.
Model Behavior with Format Changes: Interestingly, GPT-4 can exhibit different behavior with slight format tweaks. For example, providing the categories in a JSON array vs. a bullet list vs. inlined in a sentence can all work, but you might find one format leads to more consistent outputs. JSON or XML formats in the prompt can cue the model to output in JSON/XML, which can be useful if a structured output is needed. If the prompt says: “Choose from: {"category": "<Delivered|OutForDelivery|InTransit|Exception|Pickup>"}”, the model may mimic that JSON structure. Always ensure any example format you show, you actually want back! GPT-4 will mirror formats very faithfully when the prompt is clear about it. This is why using a short pseudo-JSON in the Reddit example prompt (with curly braces around the category) was effective to stop the model from adding other text​

.
Consistency and Testing: GPT-4 generally performs better when the prompt style is consistent throughout a session. If you start with a certain formatting (say, bullet points for categories and a particular wording of the question), stick with it. Changing the format mid-way (without a new system message) could confuse the model’s expectations. Also, as a pattern, GPT-4 is highly sensitive to exact wording when uncertainty is involved. Even adding a line like “Think step by step” (to induce chain-of-thought) can alter how it answers, which might improve reasoning but could also lead it to output the reasoning if not careful. For pure classification, it’s usually best to keep the prompt straightforward and not encourage lengthy reasoning in the output unless you specifically plan to parse or use it. Some users have found that asking the model to reason internally and then give an answer can reduce errors on tricky cases – e.g., “First analyze the scan description carefully, then output the final category.” GPT-4 might then internally do what’s needed. In our prompt, we implicitly do this by saying “analyze it carefully” but we don’t ask it to show the analysis. If you ever do want the reasoning (perhaps for debug), you could request an explanation after the category in a second turn. But in a production setting, likely you only want the category.
Leverage GPT-4’s Strengths: GPT-4 has a broader general knowledge and better reasoning than earlier models. It knows a lot about how shipping and delivery processes work (from training data). The prompt we crafted leverages this by using phrases like “typical logistics operations” – GPT-4 will draw on its understanding of what’s typical. So a pattern is: use natural language cues that align with real-world logic. The model often does a good job if the prompt appeals to reasoning (“if X then likely Y”). For instance, telling it that “Label created means the package isn’t yet picked up” arms it with a fact, and it will apply that. Think of these as mini rules or knowledge injections. Unlike a rigid program, GPT-4 can use these hints flexibly on novel inputs. This makes prompt engineering a powerful way to handle edge conditions without additional coding.
Finally, always remember to evaluate and iterate. Prompt engineering is as much an art as a science, and even minor edits can shift performance. If GPT-4 misclassifies something, analyze the prompt: Was there a phrase that might have misled it? Is there an instruction missing? You can then refine your prompt to address that. Over time, you’ll converge on a prompt that yields high accuracy for your classification task.
