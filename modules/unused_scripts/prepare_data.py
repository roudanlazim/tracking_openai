    You are a logistics expert. Analyze the shipping journey and return ONLY the most appropriate final status from the following list:
    {json.dumps(status_elements, indent=2)}

    **Rules:**
    - Choose ONLY one status from the list above. Do NOT generate any explanation or extra text.
    - Resolving scans indicate issue resolution.
    - If a new action-required scan appears, update accordingly.
    - Do NOT assume 'Delivered' if later scans suggest otherwise.
    - A Resolving scan from the list indicates issue resolution; no resolving scan means the status is still active.

    **Action-Required Scans:**
    {json.dumps(scan_groups_list, indent=2)}

    **Resolving Scans:**
    {json.dumps(resolving_scans, indent=2)}

    AI Story:
