Fine-Tuning Plan for Shipment Tracking JSON Responses
Objective
The goal is to fine-tune a model to illustrate it working. I have chosen the JSON schema because it takes lots of space and it needs to be consistent  -IE  so that it consistently generates structured JSON responses that strictly follow prompt_schema.json, ensuring accurate shipment tracking updates.

The JSON schema for tracking responses is defined in prompt_schema.json.
The model should always return a single JSON object with a "progress" field.
The "progress" field must be one of the allowed statuses:
"Manifested"
"Collected"
"InTransit"
"Delivered"
"PartiallyDelivered"
"BeingReturned"
"Returned"
"CollectionFailed"
"OutForDelivery"


1. Prepare Training Data
Fine-tuning requires a structured dataset in .jsonl format containing system prompts, user inputs, and correctly formatted JSON outputs.

1.1 Generate Example Training Data
Each training example should:

Use a system prompt instructing the model to follow prompt_schema.json.
Include a user message with shipment scan data.
Ensure the assistant’s response is a structured JSON object matching the schema.
Example 1: Package Out for Delivery
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "<Your system prompt>" },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Carrier scan data: Package is out for delivery."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "{
        \"progress\": \"OutForDelivery\"
      }"
    }
  ]
}
Example 2: Delivery Failed Due to Bad Address
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "messages": [
    { "role": "system", "content": "<Your system prompt>" },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Scan data indicates: Delivery failed due to a bad address."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "{
        \"progress\": \"CollectionFailed\"
      }"
    }
  ]
}


1.2 Ensure Coverage of All Possible Cases
Your training dataset should include:

✅ Manifested Shipments
✅ Collected Packages
✅ Shipments In Transit
✅ Deliveries
✅ Returns
✅ Collection Failures
✅ Edge Cases (Ambiguous Scan Data, etc.)
1.3 Store Training Data in JSONL Format
Each example should be a single line in training_data_stage1.jsonl.
Validate formatting using a JSON linter or a Python script.


2. Fine-Tuning Process
2.1 Prepare and Upload Data
Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted:

sh
Copy
Edit
openai tools fine_tunes.prepare_data -f training_data_stage1.jsonl
Upload the dataset:

sh
Copy
Edit
openai api fine_tunes.create -t "training_data_stage1.jsonl" -m "gpt-4o-mini"
Replace "gpt-4o-mini" with the appropriate base model.
Save the fine-tuned model ID (e.g., ft:gpt-4o-mini:xxxxx).


3. Test Fine-Tuned Model
After fine-tuning completes:

3.1 Generate JSON Outputs
Run a test query:

python
Copy
Edit
import openai

openai.api_key = "your-api-key"

response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
    model="ft:gpt-4o-mini:xxxxx",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "<Your system prompt>"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Scan shows package delivery failed due to a bad address."}
    ]
)

print(response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"])
3.2 Validate Output
Ensure the response follows prompt_schema.json.
The "progress" field should always contain a valid status.


4. Iterate and Improve
If the model’s outputs are inconsistent:

Expand Training Data
Add more cases with different phrasings and variations.
Ensure JSON Consistency
Responses should strictly follow prompt_schema.json.
Retrain & Test Again
Repeat fine-tuning with an improved dataset.
Summary
✅ Objective: Ensure correct JSON responses for shipment tracking based on prompt_schema.json.
✅ Data: Create 10–20 structured .jsonl examples covering different shipment statuses.
✅ Fine-Tune: Upload & fine-tune using OpenAI’s API.
✅ Test: Validate model responses against unseen inputs.
✅ Iterate: Expand dataset and refine the model as needed.

This updated plan ensures that all responses strictly conform to prompt_schema.json, with "progress" as the only key.
